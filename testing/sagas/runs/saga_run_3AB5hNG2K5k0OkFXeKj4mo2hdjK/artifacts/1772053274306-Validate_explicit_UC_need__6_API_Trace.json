While the linked use case mentions that regular customers receive earlier access to booking slots, there is no concrete evidence in the prior steps that confirms this behavior is implemented or functioning as required. Specifically, the evidence does not show any mechanism or feature that explicitly rewards regular customers, leading to a gap in fulfilling the requirement.",
