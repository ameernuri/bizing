  "description": "Comprehensive lifecycle saga derived from UC-143 and persona P-1. Needs summary: Policy document upload (PDF) or built-in editor; Version control and change tracking; Acknowledgment required before shift booking/work assignment; Separate policies for different roles (drivers, warehouse, office); Annual renewal requirement; Quiz/assessment option (confirm they read it); Multi-language support; Bulk distribution to employee groups; Follow-up reminders for non-signers; Audit trail with timestamp and IP; Export for compliance audits; Integration with onboarding workflows; **Safety Policy Update:** Company updates forklift safety policy. Uploads new version to system. All warehouse staff receive notification: \"New safety policy requires acknowledgment by Friday.\" Staff must read and digitally sign before they can clock in for next shift. One employee hasn't signed by Thursday - supervisor gets alert, follows up. Friday 5pm - 100% compliance achieved. Audit log shows exactly who signed when.; **Employee Handbook:** New hire onboarding - receives handbook via email, reviews on mobile, digitally signs acknowledgment. Can't proceed to schedule training shifts until signed. HR dashboard shows completion status for all new hires.; **Franchise Policy:** Franchise corporate distributes updated brand standards policy. All 47 franchise locations must have employees acknowledge within 30 days. System tracks completion by location. Flagged: Location #23 only 60% compliant - franchise business coach reaches out.",
